# hello-world
trying out the tutorial, this is my trial repository

So, I'm trying out this branch and adding info about myself.  this is my branch text I
added.  now I'm guessing I commit it.  

var = 7 (this is only in the new branch)  
// did you know that 7 was an unlucky number in Mongol culture?  //
